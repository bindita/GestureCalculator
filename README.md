We introduce <i>GestureCalc</i>, a digital calculator that uses target-free gestures for arithmetic tasks. It allows eyes-free input in the form of taps and directional swipes with one to three fingers, guided by minimal audio feedback, to enter digits and operations. Our main contributions are:

* It is a novel eyes-free target-less digital calculator application that uses a minimal number of accessible gestures to enter digits and operations. We plan to release the app on the App store.

* It uses intuitive gestures based on conceptual metaphors that are both memorable and easily learnable for visually impaired people.

* In a mixed methods longitudinal study with eight screen reader users we found that they  entered characters with <i>GestureCalc</i> 40.5\% faster on average than with a typical touch screen calculator (baseline). They made more mistakes but also corrected more errors with <i>GestureCalc</i>, resulting in 52.2\% fewer erroneous calculations than the baseline.
